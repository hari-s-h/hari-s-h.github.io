limited width, and minimal formatting. The intent is to maintain
clarity and simplicity.
## Example
The content is written in plain Markdown, but rendered in a style
that resembles rfc-editor.org publications.
## Security Considerations

## Conclusion
This demonstrates how to create a minimal RFC-style blog using
Jekyll and GitHub Pages.
